## Information about the game.
Ninja's Path

Short 2D platform game with enemies that make pathfinding.
There are two types of controls.

For gameplay:
 - Left  			= "D"
 - Right 			= "A"
 - Slide 			= "S + A/D"
 - Jump  			= "Space"
 - Sprint			= "A/D + Left Shift"
 - Music Volume Up 		= "+"
 - Music Volume Down 		= "-"
 - Save  			= "F5"
 - Load				 = "F6"
 - Pause    = "P"
 - Select GUI buttons = "Shift"
 - Execute selected button = "Enter"

For Testing:
 - First Scene     		= "F1"
 - Start of Scene 		= "F2"
 - See Colliders 		= "F3"
 - Show Colliders GUI & Enemies Pathfinding			= "F8"
 - Save				= "F5"
 - Load				= "F6"
 - God Mode			= "F10"

We tried to implement slow motion in the game, but we ran out of time and so we couldn't adapt it to our mechanics.
You can test it pressing Q.
